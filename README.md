# GraknAutoPOP
`GraknAutoPOP` is a wrapper for the Automatic POPulation of a [Grakn](http://grakn.ai/) 
Knowledge Graph using [Grakn Python client](https://dev.grakn.ai/docs/language-drivers/client-python).
The functions created are based on the specific input structure of the file 
that is described in the article:

[Automatic population of a Grakn Knowledge Graph
 from a single input file]().
 
For the example proposed, I'm relying on data taken from two articles created by 
[Soroush Saffari](https://blog.grakn.ai/@soroush_26094) of the Grakn team:

Schema: [Whoâ€™s calling? Grakn. Model and Load a schema into a knowledge graph](https://blog.grakn.ai/whos-calling-grakn-model-and-load-a-schema-into-a-knowledge-graph-f18541faec89).

Instances: [Loading data and querying knowledge from a Grakn Knowledge Graph using the Python client](https://blog.grakn.ai/loading-data-and-querying-knowledge-from-a-grakn-knowledge-graph-using-the-python-client-b764a476cda8).
